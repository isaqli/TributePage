#Van Gogh Tribute

### What does my project do
> This project is a simple website that pays tribute to the life, art, and legacy of Vincent van Gogh, showcasing his artistic periods, famous works, and a few of my own artworks inspired by him.

### Why I made my project
>Van Gogh's artworks were one of the first things that got me really interested in creating art for myself! I loved how his artworks looked dreamy, nostalgic, honest and really expressive of his feelings. His artworks have always stood out to me, and that's why I created this website as a tribute to his life, unique styles, and impacts in the art community.

### How I made my project
>I built the website using HTML and CSS! I organized each subtopic using the (section) tag to keep the content organized and easy to navigate.

### Struggles
>I struggled a lot in using CSS to design the layout of the website. It was especially hard making the divider card thingys with the images and texts inside, but eventually I was able to solve it! I had to research a few times on how to add color or box-shadows to images or dividers too.
