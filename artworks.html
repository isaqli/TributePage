      <h1>My Artworks Inspired by Van Gogh!</h1>
      <p>
        These selected artworks were part of my 2025 AP Drawing portfolio and were inspired 
        by Van Gogh’s style. I know some of them have mistakes or areas that could be improved, 
        but each piece helped me grow and better understand how to express emotion through art.

          This was actually my first time using acrylic paint on my artwork! There was a lot of frustration 
          and impatience with this piece since it took quite a while to complete as I was not used to painting with acrylics. I layered blue, white, and 
          yellow for the swirly background, and you can probably tell it was inspired by Starry Night. I wish 
          I could’ve added more yellow illuminated by the glowing flame, but overall, it turned out quite nice in the end.

          This was also my first time using ink and a fountain pen for an artwork. The lines and details were really tedious to create, 
          and it took me hours to complete. This piece shows a solitary white figure standing before a dark forest, beneath a sky filled with swirling winds 
          and unblinking eyes. I drew inspiration from Van Gogh's "Road with Cypress and Star” (1890). Van Gogh often painted 
          emotion through nature, and I aimed to reflect that same spirit in this work.
