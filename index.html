            Vincent Van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist known for his bold colors, expressive brushstrokes, and emotional depth. Even though he is now celebrated
            as a renowned artist in current culture, he was largely unrecognized in his lifetime. Despite personal struggles, his art went on to inspire people around 
            the world!
          </p>
          <p>
            Van Gogh's artworks were one of the first things that got me really interested in creating art for myself! I loved how his artworks not only looked dreamy and nostalgic, 
            but also honest and really expressive of his feelings, which makes his art even more meaningful. His artworks have always stood out to me, and that's why I created this website 
            as a tribute to his life, his unique styles that he developed, and the significant impacts he made in the art community.

        <div class="artwork">
          <h3>Early Dutch Period (1880-1885)</h3>
          <p>Van Gogh during this time mainly focused using dark colors, rough, and earthy tones in order to depict peasant life and landscapes.</p>
          <p>Example: <strong>The Potato Eaters (1885)</strong></p>

          <h3>Paris Period (1886-1888)</h3>
          <p>Van Gogh moved to Paris where he discovered bright colors and Impressionism. This is where his style became lighter and more vibrant.</p>
          <p>Example: <strong>Self-Portrait with a Straw Hat (1887)</strong></p>

          <h3>Starry Night (1889)</h3>
          <p>
            This artwork was painted while Van Gogh was staying at a mental hospital in Saint-Rémy. This painting shows a swirling night sky over a quiet village
            where it reflects his emotions as a mix of both chaos and beauty. This is one of his most famous paintings in the world today!

          <h3>Café Terrace at Night (1888)</h3>
          <p>
            Van Gogh painted this in Arles, France, which shows a real cafe he visited and was also one of his first paintings that included a starry night. This artwork
            shows a peaceful nighttime scene with warm yellow lights around which creates avery  calm and inviting mood. Interestingly, Van Gogh actually did not use any black at all for this
            piece, just color and contrast!
