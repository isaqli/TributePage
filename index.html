            Vincent Van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist artist who was well-known for his elaborate use of intense colors, expressive brushstrokes, and the deep raw emotions 
            poured into his works. Even though, Van Gogh is seen as a well renowned artist in current culture, he was relatively unknown and not widely appreciated for his works 
            during his lifetime. Despite his personal struggles he had faced, his works would come and inspire many artists and viewers around the globe!   
          </p>
          <p>
            Van Gogh's artworks were one of the first things that got me really interested in creating art for myself. I loved how his artworks not only looked dreamy and nostalgic, 
            but also honest and really expressive of his feelings, which makes his art even more meaningful. His artworks have always stood out to me, and that's why I created this website 
            as a tribute to his life, his unique styles that he developed, and the significant impacts he made in the art community.

          <h3>Early Dutch Period (1880-1885)</h3>
          <p>Van Gogh during this time mainly focused using dark colors, rough, and earthy tones in order to depict peasant life and landscapes.</p>
          <p>Example: <strong>The Potato Eaters (1885)</strong></p>

          <h3>Paris Period (1886-1888)</h3>
          <p>Van Gogh moved to Paris where he discovered bright colors and Impressionism. This is where his style became lighter and more vibrant.</p>
          <p>Example: <strong>Self-Portrait with a Straw Hat (1887)</strong></p>
